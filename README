Problem:
To hide the original IP from where the request has originated.

As part of one of the requirement we had, we were not to disclose the ip from where the request for the feed has originated while the application is in development stage. This required the use of a proxy server which will "proxify" the request route. i.e each and every request will go through proxify app which is hosted with some other server, thus, shielding the original IP.


Solution:
We decided to create a simple app which acts like a proxy.

Proxify accepts requests in any format, forwards it to the desired server, gets response from the server and returns the response back to the requesting server.


Usage:
Proxify URL can be directly requested with a 'url' as parameter and the response will be returned.
A live demo is available at http://proxify.heroku.com

Examples:
Some examples of different response formats are as follows

HTML(all the requests for css, javascripts and images will be routed via proxify)
http://proxify.heroku.com/?url=sapnasolutions.com

JSON
http://proxify.heroku.com/?url=https://graph.facebook.com/sapnasolutions

XML
http://proxify.heroku.com/?url=http://api.myminister.info/states.xml

Image
http://proxify.heroku.com/?url=http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logos/images_logo_lg.gif

It also handles basic authentication. You just need to provide the credentials and the site is available for browsing.
